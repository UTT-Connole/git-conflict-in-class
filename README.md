some stuff to conflict
1. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
2. Blue skies and green grass make a perfect day.
3. Coffee fuels code and creativity alike.
4. Penguins waddle across icy landscapes.
5. Raindrops tap gently on the window pane.
6. A single star shines in the midnight sky.
7. Keyboard clicks echo in the silent room.
8. Mountains rise tall above the valley floor.
9. Paper airplanes soar through the classroom.
10. Lightning flashes, illuminating the night.
